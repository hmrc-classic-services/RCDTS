QA Exercise

General Guidance:
	- Upload the template projects to a private gitlab repository
	- Add @RCDTS as a developer on the created project.
	- All commit messages should follow the template of:
		SDE-{TASK_ID + Unique 3 digit code}: {COMMIT MESSAGE}
		e.g. SDE-0001: Uploaded initial project template
	- Ensure that any added functionality or corrected errors have appropriately named JUnit tests to ensure they work. 
	- Where instructions are vague, reasonable assumptions should be made and documented.
