The guidance is included alongside the project framework. 

### Internal Test

This part of the test will include the same restrictions as the first. This part of the test contains two parts, one is an extension of the previous part (in order to confirm that people did complete the initial section) and a subsequent task to check how they handle a complete task from inception to completion.
